# Pages

Complete pages for a page-based application (like a website) or screens/activities for screen-based applications (like mobile apps).

This layer is similar to Widgets in its compositional nature, albeit on a larger scale. Each slice in this layer contains UI components that are ready to be plugged into a router and sometimes data-fetching logic and error handling.

**Slice examples:**

For a social network:
- News feed
- Community page
- User's public profile

For a Git frontend (e.g., GitHub):
- Repository page
- User's repositories
- Branches in a repository

# Features

Actions that a user can make in the application to interact with the business entities to achieve a valuable outcome. This also includes actions that the app makes on behalf of the user to produce value for them.

Each slice in this layer can contain interactive UI elements, internal state and API calls that enable value-producing actions.

**Slice examples:**

For a social network:
- Authenticate
- Create a post
- Join a group

For a Git frontend (e.g., GitHub):
- Edit a file
- Leave a comment
- Merge branches

Actions on behalf of users:
- Detect dark mode
- Perform background computation
- User-Agent-based actions
